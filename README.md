## Game Description

* There are 16 cards in the deck, which are then laid out in a grid, face-down.
* Each card must be flipped face-up to reveal its symbol.
* There are 8 unique symbols, so only two cards ever have the same symbol.
* The object of the game is to match each pair of cards with the same symbol.

## How To Play

* Click on any card to begin the game. A timer will start to count up.
* Then click on another face-down card to flip it face-up. If the two face-up cards match, then they lock in place and you can flip over more cards. But if the two cards do not match, then they will flip face-down again.
* Depending on how many moves it takes you to match all of the cards, you receive a star rating between 1 and 3--3 being the highest score.
* When all cards are matched, the game is over. The timer stops and your final star rating is displayed.
* You can restart the game at any time by hitting the restart button.
